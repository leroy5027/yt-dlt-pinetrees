RE:  YT-DLP

The two following issues have appeared recently with no changes from me.  Same software and hardware on my end and not even one problem downloading any of many videos and links over a long period.

I do not understand the ".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE_broken_site" instructions. I cannot find a blank template to fill out.  Hence, I'm going to try to send this via email. I can't find a support email address or any other way to contact anyone related to yt-DLP, so I'm going to try to email "support@github.com." 

I have D/L YT-DPL from  ubuntu "software." removed/purged and re-D/L from ubuntu "software and  Synaptic multiple times. Unable to determine proper file to D/L from Github screens. All with the same results.  The text included below is copy/pasted from my terminal screen.

OS = Xubuntu 20.04.3   AmD 64
